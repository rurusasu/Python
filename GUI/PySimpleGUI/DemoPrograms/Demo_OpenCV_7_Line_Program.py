Putting the comment at the bottom so that you can see that the code is indeed 7 lines long.  And, there is nothing
done out of the ordinary to make it 7 lines long.  There are no ; for example.  OK, so the if statement is on one line
but that's the only place that you would traditionally see one more line.  So, call it 8 if you want.
