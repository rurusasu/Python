"""
    DESIGN PATTERN - Multithreaded Long Tasks GUI
    Presents one method for running long-running operations in a PySimpleGUI environment.
    The PySimpleGUI code, and thus the underlying GUI framework, runs as the primary, main thread
    The "long work" is contained in the thread that is being started.

    A queue.Queue is used by the threads to communicate with main GUI code
    The PySimpleGUI code is structured just like a typical PySimpleGUI program.  A layout defined,
        a Window is created, and an event loop is executed.
    What's different is that within this otherwise normal PySimpleGUI Event Loop, there is a check for items
        in the Queue.  If there are items found, process them by making GUI changes, and continue.

    This design pattern works for all of the flavors of PySimpleGUI including the Web and also repl.it
    You'll find a repl.it version here: https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Async-With-Queue-Communicationspy
